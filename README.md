# Visible Toggle Sprint
A simple mod to make toggle sprint & sneak easier!

## [NEEDS YACL LIB](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl)

I struggle to remember if I have toggle sprint on or not, so I just decided to make this mod to make it easier.
The mod also renders toggle sneak. So all life is much essayer if you are dumb like me :)

There are 3 different ways to display the sprint or sneak status : 
- On the Crosshair
- Next to the Hotbar
- As Text anywhere on the screen
