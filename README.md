# Visible Toggle Sprint
A simple mod to make toggle sprint easier!

I struggle to remember if I have toggle sprint on or not, so I just decided to amke this mod to make it easier.
Also, for the future I want to have a little icon appear next to the crosshair and not text above the hotbar. But I don't know how rendering(for now).
*If you know pls send me a message [Ender#8344]*
